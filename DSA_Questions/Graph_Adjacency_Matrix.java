/*You need to implement an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix. The program should allow the user to:

Input the number of vertices (N) and number of edges (E).
Enter E pairs of vertices (U, V) that represent edges between vertex U and V.
Print the adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Input Format:
An integer N → Number of vertices.
An integer E → Number of edges.
E lines, each containing two integers U V representing an edge between vertex U and vertex V.
Output Format:
The adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ E ≤ N*(N-1)/2 (No self-loops and no parallel edges)
1 ≤ U, V ≤ N
For example:

Input	Result
4 3     0 1 0 1
1 2     1 0 1 0
2 3     0 1 0 0
4 1     1 0 0 0
