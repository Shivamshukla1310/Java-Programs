Java Methods:-
---> A method is a block of code that performs a specific task, In Java There are 2 types of methods
1. User Defined Methods
2. Standard Library Methods(Built-in Methods)

Syntax:-
returntype methodname(args(Optional))
{
	.
	.
	.	
	Body of the method
}

---> Here Return type Specifies What type of value a method returns
	For Ex:- * If a method has int return type then it returns an integer value if the method doesn't return a value its return type is void.
		 * Method name is an identifier that is used to refer to the particular method in aa program.
		 * method body It includes the programing statements that are used to perform some task,the method body is enclosed inside the curly braces{}.

Access Modifiers in java:-
---> the access modifiers are used to set visibility of classes,interfaces,variables,methods,constructurs,setter methods etc.
NOTE:- You cannot set access modifiers for getter methods.
Types Of access modifiers
1.Public
	When we use methods ,variables,classes as public then we can access them from anywhere,the public access modifiers has no scope restriction.
2.Protected
	When Methods and data members are declared as protected, we can access them within the same package as well as from sub classes.
	NOTE:- We cannot declare classes and interfaces as protected in java
3.Private
	When variables,and methods are declared as private,they cannot be accesed outsidde of the class.
	NOTE:- We cannot declare classes and interfaces as private in java,however the nested classes can be declared as private.
4.Default
	IF we do not explicitly specify any access modifier for classes,methods,variables,etc then by default it is considered as default access modifier.
