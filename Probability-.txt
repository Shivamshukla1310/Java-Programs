Probability:-
The Chance or likelihood of an event happening
---> It lies b/w 0-1, and can never be negative.
Sample space:- Number of possible outcomes

formula --> p(a)/sample space

Q-1 A marble is randomly selected from a box containing 5 green, 3 red, 7 blue
find the probability that the marble is 
1) Red --> 3/15 = 1/5
2) Green --> 5/15
3) Blue --> 7/15
4) not red --> 12/15
5) neither green nor blue --> 3/15
6) green or red --> 8/15

2) An orange ticket --> 0/12
3) neither yellow or blue ticket --> 9/12

Q-3 in a class of 30 student 19 study physics 17 study chemistry and 15 study both draw a vein diagram.
find the probability if the student is randomly selected, find the probavility that he chose...

2) at least one of them --> 21/30
3) Physics but not chemistry --> 4/30
4) exactly one of the subject --> 6/30
5) neither physics nor chemistry --> 9/30
